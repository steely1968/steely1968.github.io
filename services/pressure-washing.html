<p>
Outdoor surfaces face constant exposure to the elements. Rain, algae, moss, car oil, tyre marks, mud, UV fading and pollution all contribute to the gradual decline of driveways, patios, decking and pathways. Many homeowners are surprised by how quickly surfaces lose their original colour and how easily they can become slippery, unsafe and unattractive.
Fortunately, most of this can be reversed with the right pressure washing equipment and experienced hands.
</p>

<h2>Our Professional Pressure Washing Services</h2>

<h3>✔ Driveway Pressure Washing</h3>
<p>
Block paving, concrete, resin-bound and tarmac driveways collect years of dirt, moss, tyre marks, algae and oil. Our professional cleaning process lifts deep-set grime and organic growth, restoring both appearance and safety. We carefully adjust pressure settings depending on the surface material to prevent damage.
Driveway cleaning is one of the most transformative exterior services — often giving a property an instant visual lift.
</p>

<h3>✔ Patio & Paving Cleaning</h3>
<p>
Patios often accumulate moss, weeds, lichen and black spot due to moisture and limited sunlight. We use specialist pressure washing techniques to remove stubborn debris without damaging pointing or the stone surface.
Whether your patio is sandstone, limestone, concrete, porcelain or block paving, we restore its natural colour and remove slippery buildup.
</p>

<h3>✔ Decking Cleaning</h3>
<p>
Wooden decking requires skilled handling during cleaning. Too much pressure can cause splintering; too little won’t remove ingrained algae. Our approach gently yet effectively lifts dirt, mould and organic growth, leaving your decking clean and ready for sealing or painting if needed.
A clean deck not only looks better but is far safer underfoot.
</p>

<h3>✔ Walls, Fences & Brickwork Cleaning</h3>
<p>
Exterior walls and fences gradually darken as airborne pollutants and moss embed into the surface. Our cleaning methods brighten brick, concrete, stone, render and timber without harming the material.
Pressure washing these surfaces instantly freshens the entire property exterior.
</p>

<h3>✔ Pathway, Steps & Access Area Cleaning</h3>
<p>
Paths and steps can quickly become hazardous when covered with algae or moss. Regular pressure washing reduces slip risk and keeps access areas safe for families, visitors and customers.
We restore clarity, brightness and grip to all walkway surfaces.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Pressure washing is one of the most effective ways to restore the external surfaces of your property. Over time, driveways, patios and pathways accumulate a mixture of organic growth and environmental pollutants. These build up gradually, often going unnoticed until the surface becomes slippery, unsightly or patched with discolouration.
Our pressure washing service reverses this natural wear and helps protect surfaces from long-term deterioration.
</p>

<p>
We begin by assessing the condition of your exterior surfaces, identifying any areas requiring special care. Different materials respond differently to pressure, so we adjust our settings to avoid damage while achieving a deep and even clean.
This careful preparation ensures you receive the best possible results without compromising your property’s safety or appearance.
</p>

<p>
For driveways, we pay particular attention to removing oil stains, moss between blocks, and stubborn marks. Patios often require a more delicate approach due to jointing sand, soft stone or older pavers. Decking demands its own specialised technique to lift dirt without roughening the wood.
No matter the surface, our goal is always the same: restore the material’s natural look and extend its lifespan.
</p>

<p>
Regular pressure washing is also one of the most cost-effective ways to maintain your property’s kerb appeal. Clean outdoor spaces create a strong first impression and help preserve surfaces that would otherwise degrade faster due to moisture, moss, weeds and dirt.
Many customers are amazed at how much difference a single clean can make — outdoor areas often look newly installed once the grime is removed.
</p>
