<h1>Fence & Gate Fitting Services in Askern DN6</h1>

<p>
Welcome to <strong>Home Repairs 4U</strong>, your trusted local specialists for fence installation, gate fitting and custom outdoor wooden builds throughout Askern DN6 and the surrounding villages.
If your garden needs a new fence, stronger gates, a practical shed or a reliable storage solution, we provide high-quality workmanship that’s built to last.
</p>

<p>
With decades of hands-on experience and a commitment to durable results, we take care of everything from replacing a damaged panel to installing an entirely new boundary. Each job is completed with care, precision and a clear focus on long-term strength.
</p>

<h2>Full Fence Installation</h2>

<p>
A new fence can completely transform the look of your property while providing privacy, security and a clean, defined boundary. Our fence installation service covers everything from traditional panels to fully bespoke wooden fencing designed and built on site.
</p>

<p>
We supply and install:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard timber fence panels</li>
<li>Featheredge/closeboard fencing</li>
<li>Picket and decorative fencing</li>
<li>Post-and-rail for larger boundary areas</li>
<li>Heavy-duty gravel boards</li>
<li>Concrete or wooden posts</li>
<li>Custom-built panel sections</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every fence is installed using the correct fixings, solid support and accurate alignment to ensure your new boundary stays straight, secure and resistant to weathering.
We discuss style, height and material options during our visit so you get the look and durability you expect.
</p>

<h2>Fence Repairs & Maintenance</h2>

<p>
Not every fence needs replacing. In many cases, a repair can add years of life to your existing structure while keeping costs down. We carry out efficient repairs that restore stability and appearance, ensuring your fence remains safe and functional.
</p>

<p>
Common repairs include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken or loose panels</li>
<li>Leaning or rotten posts</li>
<li>Storm damage and wind-blown sections</li>
<li>Loose rails or fixings</li>
<li>Sagging gravel boards</li>
<li>Gate frame repairs</li>
</ul>

<p>
We assess the extent of the damage and provide honest recommendations — whether a repair is possible or a replacement would be more cost-effective.
</p>

<h2>Professional Gate Fitting</h2>

<p>
A well-fitted gate improves security, privacy and access to your garden or driveway. We install made-to-measure gates that match your fencing and the character of your property.
</p>

<p>
Gate options include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Garden gates</li>
<li>Driveway double gates</li>
<li>Side entrance gates</li>
<li>Decorative wooden gates</li>
<li>Heavy duty framed gates</li>
<li>Custom sizes and designs</li>
</ul>

<p>
We ensure each gate is hung correctly, opens smoothly and is supported with suitable hinges, bolts, latches and posts.
If your current gate is misaligned or difficult to open, we also offer repairs and adjustments.
</p>

<h2>Custom Wooden Shed Builds</h2>

<p>
A shed should suit your garden, not the other way around. We build solid, practical wooden sheds tailored to the exact size and layout you need. Whether it’s simple storage or a small workshop, we create strong structures designed for everyday use.
</p>

<p>
Your shed can include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Reinforced flooring for heavy tools</li>
<li>Secure doors and locks</li>
<li>Windows and ventilation</li>
<li>Built-in shelves and internal storage</li>
<li>Weatherproof roofing and felt</li>
<li>Double-door access for larger items</li>
</ul>

<p>
All sheds are built from quality timber and assembled with reliability and longevity in mind.
</p>

<h2>Wooden Bin Tidies & Log Stores</h2>

<p>
If you want a cleaner, more organised outdoor space, our custom-built bin tidies and log stores provide a tidy and practical solution.
These units are ideal for concealing wheelie bins, recycling containers, garden tools and firewood.
</p>

<p>
We build:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Wheelie bin enclosures (single, double or triple)</li>
<li>Recycling storage units</li>
<li>Garden log stores</li>
<li>Multi-purpose outdoor cupboards</li>
<li>Custom-sized storage units</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each unit is designed with ventilation, durability and easy access in mind. You choose the size, layout and finish — we take care of the construction.
</p>
