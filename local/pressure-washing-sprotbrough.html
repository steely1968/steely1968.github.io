<h2>Surfaces That Can Be Effectively Cleaned With Pressure Washing</h2>
<p>Pressure washing is a highly versatile cleaning method that can be used on a wide range of exterior surfaces around residential and commercial properties. Hard surfaces such as concrete, block paving, and paving slabs respond particularly well to pressure washing, as built-up dirt, oil stains, and algae can be lifted from deep within the surface. Driveways and paths benefit greatly, instantly improving appearance and safety. Patios and outdoor seating areas can be refreshed by removing moss and grime that accumulate due to damp weather.</p>
<P>Pressure washing is also effective on brickwork, stone walls, and rendered surfaces when the correct pressure levels are applied. Wooden decking can be cleaned carefully to remove slippery algae and restore its natural look without splintering. Fencing, garage floors, steps, and entranceways can all be cleaned to improve hygiene and presentation. Even commercial areas such as car parks, forecourts, and loading bays can be safely pressure washed to maintain a professional appearance. When carried out correctly, pressure washing not only improves how surfaces look but also helps extend their lifespan by preventing long-term damage caused by dirt and organic growth.</P>
