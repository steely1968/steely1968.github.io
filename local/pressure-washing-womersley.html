<h2>Patios, Paths & Decking</h2>
<p>Patios, paths and decking can quickly become slippery and discoloured due to algae, moss and dirt. In Womersley’s rural setting, shaded garden areas can be especially prone to green growth. Pressure washing removes this build-up, revealing cleaner, safer surfaces that you can enjoy all year round.</p>
<p>From porcelain patio slabs to wooden decking and composite boards, we use the right pressure and cleaning approach for each material. Regular pressure washing not only improves appearance but also extends the life of outdoor surfaces by preventing decay and moisture retention.</p>

<h2>Exterior Wall Cleaning in Womersley</h2>
