<section style="max-width:900px; margin:40px auto; padding:0 15px;">

<h2 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;">Frequently Asked Questions About Pressure Washing in Selby</h2>

<div>
<p><strong>What is pressure washing and how does it work?</strong><br>
Pressure washing uses high-pressure water to remove dirt, moss, algae, oil stains, and grime from outdoor surfaces. The force of the water breaks down built-up contaminants that cannot be removed with normal cleaning methods, restoring the surface’s original appearance.</p>

<p><strong>What surfaces can be safely pressure washed?</strong><br>
Pressure washing is suitable for many exterior surfaces including driveways, patios, paving, pathways, brick walls, decking, fences, and outdoor furniture. The pressure level is adjusted to match the material to avoid damage.</p>

<p><strong>Is pressure washing safe for my property?</strong><br>
When carried out professionally, pressure washing is safe and effective. Using the correct pressure and technique prevents damage to surfaces while ensuring a thorough clean. An assessment is always recommended before starting work.</p>

<p><strong>How often should pressure washing be done?</strong><br>
Most properties benefit from pressure washing once a year. Areas exposed to heavy foot traffic, shade, or damp conditions may require more frequent cleaning to prevent moss and algae build-up.</p>

<p><strong>Does pressure washing remove moss and algae completely?</strong><br>
Yes, pressure washing effectively removes visible moss, algae, and organic growth. For longer-lasting results, additional treatments can be applied to slow regrowth and keep surfaces cleaner for longer.</p>

<p><strong>Can pressure washing improve safety?</strong><br>
Pressure washing improves safety by removing slippery algae, moss, and grime from walkways, patios, and driveways. This reduces the risk of slips and falls, especially during wet weather.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need pressure washing before sealing or painting?</strong><br>
Yes, pressure washing is an important preparation step before sealing or painting. It removes dirt and loose debris, allowing coatings to adhere properly and last longer.</p>
