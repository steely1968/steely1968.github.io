<!-- Section 1 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Internal Minor Home Repairs</h2>
<p>Internal minor home repairs cover all the small jobs that make a big difference to your home. From fixing doors that won’t close properly and repairing damaged walls, to replacing broken fittings and sorting loose fixtures, every job is handled with care and attention to detail. These are the types of repairs that often get put off, but leaving them can lead to bigger problems later. Getting them sorted quickly keeps your home safe, tidy and comfortable. Whether it’s wear and tear, accidental damage or general maintenance, internal minor repairs help keep everything working as it should, without the cost or disruption of major building work.</p>

<!-- Section 2 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Guttering Services</h2>
<p>Guttering services are essential for protecting your home from water damage. Over time, gutters can fill with leaves, moss and debris, stopping rainwater from flowing away properly. Cleaning and clearing your gutters helps prevent blockages, leaks and overflowing that can damage walls, roofs and foundations. If your gutters are leaking, sagging or broken, repairs can restore them before bigger problems develop. In cases where gutters are badly damaged or outdated, full replacement gives your home a fresh, reliable system that works efficiently. Regular gutter maintenance keeps rainwater under control, protects your property, and saves money by avoiding costly structural repairs later on.</p>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Exterior Decorating</h2>
<p>External decorating improves both the look and protection of your property. External house painting refreshes tired walls, boosts kerb appeal and adds a protective layer against weather damage. Painting garden rails and gates not only makes them look smarter but also helps prevent rust and wear. Fence painting keeps timber strong, protected from rot, and looking clean and well cared for. Regular exterior decorating helps your property stay attractive, increases its lifespan, and reduces the need for costly repairs caused by weather, damp and general wear and tear..</p>

<!-- Section 4 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>uPVC Restoration</h2>
<p>uPVC restoration is all about bringing tired, dirty frames and doors back to life. Over time, uPVC can become stained, dull and discoloured from weather, pollution and everyday wear. Professional cleaning restores the original look, making windows and doors bright, fresh and well cared for. This also includes cleaning fascias and guttering to the highest possible standard, improving the overall appearance of your home. Regular uPVC restoration not only makes your property look better but also helps extend the life of your fittings by keeping them clean, protected and properly maintained.</p>

<!-- Section 5 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Conservatory Valets</h2>
<p>Conservatory valets provide a thorough and detailed clean for your uPVC conservatory, both inside and out. This service includes washing the glass panels, frames, roof, and sills, removing dirt, algae, and water marks that build up over time. Every corner is carefully attended to, ensuring a spotless finish and restoring the conservatory’s original brightness. Regular conservatory valets help maintain the structure, protect the uPVC, and keep your space looking fresh, inviting, and well cared for all year round.</p>

<!-- Section 6 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Regular Window Cleaning</h2>
<p>Regular window cleaning keeps your home or business looking smart, bright and well maintained. Clean windows let in more natural light and improve the overall appearance of your property. A reliable regular service means your windows are kept consistently clear without you having to worry about it. Frames, sills and glass are cleaned thoroughly, removing dirt, dust and marks left by weather and traffic. Whether you need monthly, fortnightly or scheduled visits, regular window cleaning helps protect your windows, keeps them looking their best and saves you time and effort.</p>

<!-- Section 7 -->
<section style="margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">
<h2>Pressure Washing</h2>
<p>Pressure washing is a fast and effective way to clean outdoor surfaces and restore their original look. Over time, driveways, paths, walls, decking and roofs can become dirty, slippery and stained with moss, algae and grime. Professional pressure washing removes this build-up safely, improving both appearance and safety. Clean surfaces not only look better but also last longer when kept free from damaging dirt and growth. Pressure washing is ideal for freshening up your property, preparing surfaces for painting or simply making everything look clean, tidy and well cared for.</p>
